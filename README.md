# Title: Steps-Simulator
-------------------------
These codes to simulate the steps for the avaton gear.
We assume here the person is moving in his place, no forward steps yet implemented.
The task is now even more simpler, we only need to send the 'up arrow' command based on the steps.
--------
# Phase one:
- Simulating the steps where we issue a keypress command to the computer from the simulator [almost done],
- Implementing this mechanism using the oculus, the person will not step at this point, the simulator does. The simulator Ahmed implemented is a bit slow but efficient (read about Ahmed's simulator in a separate readme file). 
--------
# Phase two:
- Build
